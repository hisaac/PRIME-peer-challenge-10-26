# Peer Programming Challenge - Javascript - 1

Our first peer challenge! My partner for this challenge was [Emily Keenan](https://github.com/emilykeenan).

This was our first time coding with others. We exercised our knowledge of JavaScript functions and datatypes, while working pair programming style.
